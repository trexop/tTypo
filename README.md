# tTypo
Pre-pre-alpha version of 1001-th fast-access-to-spec-symbols chrome extension. I'm slowly exploring chrome's API and the code i posted here is my first "lab rat". Do not take it serious.

#### Mission
As you probably know, it's pretty hard to follow basic typography rules all the time. Some commonly use a minus sign instead of a dash or "TM" instead of "â„¢", others did invent a bunch of terrible surrogate characters like "(c)" or "!=". All that causes our eyes to bleed when we see all that rubbish, and the reason is pretty simple: our good old keyboards are quite limited.

This particular extension allows you to store most of used combinations of characters in suitable cells and copy it instantly to the clipboard when needed. One might say it's just like [horejsek's ext] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/special-characters/nipbfgjelgfmhomikiffppkdpmienjnp), but mine comes with a bit cleaner codebase (in fact, it's completely different).
