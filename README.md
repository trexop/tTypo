# tTypo
Pre-pre-alpha version of 1001-th fast-access-to-spec-symbols chrome extension. I'm slowly exploring chrome API and present code is my first guinea pig. Do not take it serious.
#### Mission
As you know, hard to always follow basic typography rules. People use minus sign  instead of dash, invented terrible surrogate characters like "(c)" or "!=", writes "TM" instead of "™" – rape eyes of reader in such different ways just because our usual keyboard is extremely humble thing.


Current extension allows you to store most used combinations of characters in suitable cells and copy it instant to clipboard when it needs. 
Just like [horejsek's ext] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/special-characters/nipbfgjelgfmhomikiffppkdpmienjnp), but mine comes with a little bit cleaner (in fact: completely different) codebase.
